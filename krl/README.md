# KRL rulesets

Note: four of these rulesets don't really belong in this repository.

## A different organization

`id.trinsic.sdk` ought to belong to Trinsic, as reflected in its name, and in what it offers.

todo: offer it to them by finding their SDK repo and issuing a pull request

## More generally useful (not used only here)

`io.picolabs.pds` is a very general purpose ruleset, and ought to be incorporated into the pico-engine repository.

todo: make it so

`html` is even more general purpose, and we need to figure out where it goes. This was borrowed (copied) from another repo and augmented.

todo: figure out where it belongs

`layout` is also general purpose, but maybe shouldn't be needed if the UI were to automatically layout new picos

todo: decide where it belongs
